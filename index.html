              I studied art, double maths and biology at A level and went on to study Physiology at university. I felt coding combined my love for creativity with my logical and mathematical brain. I really enjoyed learning how to code; it exceeded my expectations. I am fascinated by the complexity of coding and am eager to learn more; I have an itch to master everything. I would love to work at a medium to large sized company with a fun and exciting environment. I want to be part of the fast-growing technology industry with its multiple applications. Some people fear technology, however, we should focus on its power to change lives for the better. I would love the opportunity to apply my development skills in a way that would make a difference.

              I sometimes use tripadvisor when on holiday, although I never know which review to trust. They are always so different and when there is just one negative, you question yourself whether to go to that place at all. Therefore I decided to make an app where you are able to follow your friends/people that you trust and see their recommendations for each city - iRecommend.
              This was a MERN Stack application which also used a few third party APIs. I used Google Autocomplete and Google Places API to find the place a user wants to recommend. I also used Rest Countries API to get the language and currency codes for each country where there were recommendations and then used Yandex, a translating API and Oanda, an exchange rate API to provide more information for users when they click on a certain city.

              This was a group project creating a full MEAN stack app using our own API as well as others. For this app we wanted to make it easy for a user to bundle their evening together by giving them a selection of bars and restaurants near their chosen event; acting as a tool to organise their evening conveniently for them - Evening Angel. Firstly, we used Skiddle's API to return events so the user can find and select the event they are going to. We then used Google Places API to find nearby bars and restaurants in relation to the chosen event's location, within a radius chosen by the user. Once a 'bundle' is created, we provided a travel time calculation from a given starting location using Google Autocomplete and Citymapper's API.

              I love cooking and wanted to create an app that would act like a Instagram for food recipes. Users can simply just login and scroll to find a recipe that they like the look of, then click to see the ingredients and method, or also add and share their own recipes. I added features so users can comment and like recipes, therefore budding chefs are able to share their signature dishes and recieve feedback and love. This is a full stack app using Express and EJS.

            <p>
              I created a similar styled game to 'Guitar Hero' and 'Tap Tap Revenge', with the aim of the game being to tap different keys in sync with when balls coming up the page come into contact with targets at the top, all in time with music. This game was made using HTML, CSS and Javascript using the jQuery Library.
